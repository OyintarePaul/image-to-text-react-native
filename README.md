# 📖 Read Aloud

**Read Aloud** is a simple and intuitive mobile application built with React Native. The app allows users to take a picture or select one from their device's media gallery, extract any readable text from the image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and have the text read aloud using text-to-speech functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Capture a photo using the device camera
- 🖼 Select an image from the device's photo library
- 🔍 Extract text from images using OCR
- 🔊 Read extracted text aloud with a built-in text-to-speech engine
- 🌓 Clean and minimal UI with smooth user experience
